# Espe-On's Profile_page

##Overview
I built website so that I would have a profile page to act as a portfolio page. 

##Stack
This Profile Page is built with [Next.JS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) and [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript). [The site is styled with SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax). I am using [Zeit.Co](https://zeit.co/) to host a [development version](https://profile-page-git-master.espe-on.now.sh/) of the site, with a production build coming soon. 

##How to Run 
This project uses npm, you can run a dev version with "npm dev" and the tests with "npm test"

##Thankyous
I would like to thank Mike Walker, Steve Jackson, and [Wiesje van den Heerik](https://github.com/Wiesje), (and everyone at [Techswitch](https://www.techswitch.co.uk/)) for all their help and patience with me while I was learning React, Typescript, and NextJS. 

I would like to thank [Wendy Kakuda](https://github.com/alteredco) for showing me how to better style websites, 

[This guide](https://dev.to/harveyjones282/the-simplest-way-to-configure-next-js-with-sass-3en) by Harvey Jones helped me setup SCSS for styling
