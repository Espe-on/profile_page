# Espe-On's Profile_page

##Overview
I built website so that I would have a profile page to act as a portfolio page. 

##Stack
This Profile Page is built with [Next.JS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) and [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript). I use [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and Enzyme for testing, which are then used by CircleCI to prevent me breaking the master Branch. I am using [Zeit.Co](https://zeit.co/) to host a [development version](https://profile-page-git-master.espe-on.now.sh/) of the site, with a production build coming soon. 

##How to Run 
This project uses npm, you can run a dev version with "npm dev" and the tests with "npm test"
